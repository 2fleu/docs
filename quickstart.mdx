## Get started in two..? steps

Get your server hooked up with the goat.

### Step 1: Invite the bot!

<Accordion title="Use the OAUTH Link to invite the bot" icon="discord" iconType="brands">
  Use this [link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1457966941053521930&permissions=8&integration_type=0&scope=bot) to invite the bot!
</Accordion>

### Step 2: There is no step 2! (for now)

<Accordion title="Coming soon.." icon="loader">
  currently the bot works on a basis where admin commands must be given by me (fleu) to server owners so they can use admin features.. this will be changed in a recode of the bot & open-sourcing later this year!
</Accordion>
